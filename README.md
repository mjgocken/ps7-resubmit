Practice set 7 from CISC637 Intro to Database Systems. Resubmission with all controllers implemented


Built REST data services in Visual Studio from a SWARM project downloaded from:    
https://github.com/CISC181/SWARM  
This github had the start of the Client, Server, Shared, EF and UT projects for SWARM.   
The REST controllers for the Course table was just about implemented here:  
Server/Controllers/Course/CourseController.cs  
I built a controller for each of the non-ASP tables:  Course, Section, Student, Enrollment, etc.    
Each of the controllers has a default Get, Post, Put and Delete method implemented.    
After the REST layer was implemented, I tested insert/update/delete/select using POSTMAN.  

Here is the Oracle schema: [schema.docx](https://github.com/mjgocken/ps7-resubmit/files/9668715/schema.docx) (better quality).
